PhotoPrism is a server-based application for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to automatically tag and find pictures without getting in your way.
Say goodbye to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the cloud or pay monthly fees.

## What to expect ##

* Clearly structured Web interface for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
* Import everything without worrying about duplicates or RAW to JPEG conversion.
* Reverse geocoding and automated tagging based on Google TensorFlow.
* No monthly costs. No proprietary formats. No privacy concerns.

## For the early birds ##

You're welcome to play with our demo at [demo.photoprism.org](https://demo.photoprism.org).
Leave your email to get a [release notification](https://goo.gl/forms/KBPVGl9PCsOKrAv33).

Step-by-step [installation instructions](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/setup/) can be found
in our [User Guide](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/).
Developers can skip this and move on to the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki).

All you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.
Note that we just [started working](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Project-Status) 
on the UI and features are neither complete nor stable. 
We plan to ship the final app as a single binary including all dependencies.

If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask in our [help forum](https://groups.google.com/a/photoprism.org/forum/#!forum/help) 
or [contact us via email](mailto:hello@photoprism.org).

## Why this has to be free software ##

The development of every commercial product is focused on monetization.
We've [built similar apps more than once](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Mediencenter) and every single time the constraints of working
in a profit-oriented corporate environment were an impediment.

We are sure we can do better with only a fraction of the budget. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - can be very powerful.
Go itself is a [great example](https://talks.golang.org/2015/simplicity-is-complicated.slide).

Our long-term goal is to become an open platform for machine learning [research](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Research) based on real-world photo collections.
